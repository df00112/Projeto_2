MAZE_01 solution is very intuitive .. 
MAZE_05 SOLUTION : Z Z E Z E E D D D D D D D D X X X 


ADDITIONAL SPECIFICATIONS:
- When S or s is entered, player's Row and player's Col will appear, robots won't move until a move action is made.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT STATE:
- All requirements were met, from the menus, to the player input, robot movement and file manipulation.
 In this project the methodology of using Classes to define each of the moving parts of the program was
 implemented in a very robust way ( for example , implementing classes like Leaderbord or ExitDoor apart from the classes created by the teacher)

MAIN DIFFICULTIES:
- In the beggining we struggled to understand how all the classes would fit together and how it implemention would be beneficial for the adaption of the first project;

- After the initial struggles, we finally understood the benefit of having each object with it's own status, updating it while the gameplay unfolds;

- The file manipulation was very similar to the first project.
